### **Title:** 
Compensated Fairly? A Regression-Based Study of CEO Pay and Financial Outcomes

#### **Team Members:** 
Aastha Surana, Kyle Chin, Matthew Maslow

#### **Goal:** 
This project analyzes the relationship between executive compensation and company performance in publicly listed U.S. companies from 2010 to 2024. Using data from WRDS ExecuComp and Compustat, we construct a panel dataset of executive-year-firm observations across multiple industries. We apply multivariate regression models to benchmark expected executive pay and firm performance, controlling for firm size, company age, and executive title. Results are visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, highlighting patterns of overpayment, underpayment, misalignment, and sector-specific differences in the relationship between executive pay and firm financial outcomes.
